# ADBR

A modern implementation of the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) client written in Rust, focusing on code maintainability and better error handling. Currently optimized for Ubuntu systems.

## Why ADBR?

- üìù Clean, modern Rust implementation compared to AOSP's C-based ADB
- ‚ú® Improved error handling and user feedback
- üöÄ Well-structured and maintainable codebase
- üîç Easy to understand and modify

Key improvements over traditional ADB:
- Clear separation of client/server communication
- Modern error handling patterns
- Well-structured command processing

Coming Soon: A full Rust implementation of the ADB server!

## Requirements

- ADB server (running on default port 5037 or custom)
- Android device with USB debugging enabled
- Ubuntu 20.04 or newer

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from DEB Package (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and install
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xDvir/ADBRClient/main/releases/adbr_1.0.0-1.deb
sudo dpkg -i adbr_1.0.0-1.deb

# If needed, resolve dependencies
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Install build dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev musl-tools

# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add musl target
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/xDvir/ADBRClient.git
cd ADBRClient
./build_deb.sh
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# List devices
adbr devices

# File operations
adbr push local_file.txt /sdcard/
adbr pull /sdcard/remote_file.txt ./

# Shell commands
adbr shell "ls -l"

# App management
adbr install app.apk
adbr uninstall package.name

# Network
adbr forward tcp:8000 tcp:8001
```

## Configuration

Set custom ADB server:
```bash
# Environment variable
export ADB_ADDRESS=192.168.1.100:5037

# Or command-line
adbr -H 192.168.1.100 -P 5037 devices
```

## Available Commands

### Device Management
```bash
adbr devices         # List connected devices
adbr devices -w      # Monitor devices continuously
adbr wait-for-device # Wait for device to connect
adbr get-state      # Get device state
```

### File Operations
```bash
adbr push SOURCE TARGET    # Copy to device
adbr pull SOURCE TARGET    # Copy from device
```

### App Management
```bash
adbr install APP.apk      # Install an app
adbr uninstall PACKAGE    # Remove an app
```

### Network
```bash
adbr forward LOCAL REMOTE  # Forward ports
adbr reverse REMOTE LOCAL  # Reverse forward ports
```

### System
```bash
adbr root                 # Restart ADB with root
adbr unroot              # Restart ADB without root
adbr reboot              # Reboot device
adbr shell               # Start shell session
```

## Notes

- Compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 and newer
- Works with all Android devices that support ADB
- Requires an ADB server to be running
- USB debugging must be enabled on Android devices
- Binary location: `/usr/local/bin/adbr`
